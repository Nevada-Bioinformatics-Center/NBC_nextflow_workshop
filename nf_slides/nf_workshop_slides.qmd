# Fundamentals of Pipeline

## 

Data science pipelines are just like cooking & making Tacos!

## What is a Pipeline ?

::: incremental
-   A **pipeline** is an automated sequence of steps that process data, such as collection, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and storage.

-   It involves multiple software packages, often in different environments, and scripts in various programming languages.
:::

## Is it Pipeline or Workflow?

::: incremental
-   A **workflow** is a broader term that encompasses any sequence of tasks or processes

-   A **pipeline** refers to a specific type of workflow focused on processing and transforming data in a linear or sequential manner.

# Workflow Management Systems (WFMS)

## 

**Workflow Management Systems** (WFMS) such as Apache Airflow, Quickbase, Cuneiform, Common Workflow Language, Galaxy, Snakemake, Nextflow are designed to manage computational workflows in fields such as bioinformatics or data science.

-   They streamline tasks by defining dependencies and automating processes across different computational environments.

## A Traditional Pipeline Wrapped by Scientific WFMS

## Key features of WFMS include:

::: incremental
-   Run time management

-   Software management

-   Portability & interoperability

-   Reproducibility

-   Reentrancy

**Nextflow** is a scientific workflow framework that can be used by a bioinformatician or data scientist to integrate all of their bash/python/Perl/other scripts into a one cohesive pipeline that are portable, reproducible, scalable and check-pointed.

# Installation & Setup

## Pre-requisites

Nextflow can be used on any POSIX-compatible system (Linux, macOS, etc.) and on Windows through WSL.

It requires **Java 17 (or later, up to 23)**.

``` bash
java -version
```

For more information: <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html>

Note: A text editor is useful for coding purposes particularly to write Nextflow scripts. So, it is highly recommended.

## Installing Java with SDKMAN

If Java is not installed in your system, fret not! Here, we will install through [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

1.  Install SDKMAN!

    ``` bash
    curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash
    ```

2.  Open a new terminal or console

3.  Install Java

    ``` bash
    sdk install java 17.0.10-tem
    ```

4.  Confirm that Java is installed correctly

    ``` bash
    java -version
    ```

    For more information, see this [website](https://whichjdk.com/).

## Installing Nextflow

Step 1: Install nextflow by running the following command in the current directory

``` bash
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

Step 2: Make Nextflow executable

``` bash
chmod +x nextflow
```

Step 3: Move Nextflow into an executable path, e.g.

``` bash
mkdir -p $HOME/ .local/bin/
mv nextflow $HOME/ .local/bin/
```

Step 4: Confirm that Nextflow is installed correctly

``` bash
nextflow info
```

## Alternative installations {.scrollable}

### Install via Visual Studio Code editor

-   Download \[Visual Studio Code\](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>). The button or buttons should be specific to your platform and the download package should be installable.

-   Next, you can add Nextflow language support in Visual Studio Code by clicking the install button on the Nextflow language extension.

### Install via Conda

``` bash
conda install bioconda::nextflow

# Or

mamba install nextflow
```

## Setting up our Workshop Directory

Each workshop attendees should setup a training folder e.g. `nf_workshop`

``` bash
mkdir nf_workshop
cd nf_workshop
```

## Downloading Workshop Materials

The scripts and materials for this workshop can be found in the \[Nevada Bioinformatics Center\](<https://github.com/Nevada-Bioinformatics-Center/NBC_nextflow_workshop>).

To download, go to the ..

``` bash
# get the git repository
git clone https://github.com/Nevada-Bioinformatics-Center/NBC_nextflow_workshop.git
```

# Getting Started

## Objectives

1.  Understand the structure of a basic Nextflow script
2.  Create a simple process to print a message
3.  Define a workflow to run that message
4.  Execute the script to see the results

## 

So, we will be creating a simple script that prints a welcoming message.

We want to print the following message by bash code but in nextflow.

``` bash
echo "Hello, welcome to the NBC Nextflow Workshop!"
```

## Your first script

``` groovy
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

// Enable DSL 2 syntax
nextflow.enable.dsl = 2

/*
 * A Simple Nextflow script to print 'Hello, welcome to the NBC Nextflow Workshop!'
 */

// Define a process called 'greetings' that will output to standard output
 process greetings {
    
     output:
        stdout
    
    // The script section that prints the statement
     script:
    """
    echo 'Hello, welcome to the NBC Nextflow Workshop!'
    """
 }


// Workflow definition: Calls the 'greetings' process
 workflow  {

    greetings()
     
 }
```

## Let's break down our simple code .. {.scrollable}

-   The first line `!/usr/bin/env nextflow` is known as the *'Shebang'* line, specifying the location of the nextflow interpreter.
-   `nextflow.enable.dsl = 2` is used to enable DSL2 syntax.
-   Note: A line comment in nextflow starts with `//` and a comment block `/* .. */`.

## Let's break down our simple code .. {.scrollable}

1.  Defining the process:

-   The `greetings` process will run the command \`echo 'Hello, welcome to the NBC Nextflow Workshop!'

-   Note: This process does not generate an output file but simply prints the above statement to the console.

``` groovy
// Define a process called 'greetings' that will output to standard output
 process greetings {
    
     output:
        stdout
    
    // The script section that prints the statement
     script:
    """
    echo 'Hello, welcome to the NBC Nextflow Workshop!'
    """
 }
```

## Let's break down our simple code

2.  Creating the workflow:

-   The `workflow` block runs the `greetings` process.

-   This is where the execution order of processes is defined. Since, it is the only process, it will run once.

``` groovy
// Workflow definition: Calls the 'greetings' process
 workflow  {

    greetings()
     
 }
```

## Nextflow 101

Nextflow pipelines have three main parts: *processes, channels* and *workflows*.

![Nextflow process flow diagram](images/process_channels_workflows.png)

## Nextflow 101 contd .. {.scrollable}

-   A ***process*** defines the command or script to execute, while the ***executor*** determines how it's run on the target system.

    ![Nextflow Executors](images/executors.png){width="4.39in"}

-   It should be noted that, Nextflow separates the functional logic of the pipeline from the execution platform.

# Tacos with Nextflow

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will:

1.  **Prepare the tortilla** - Choose a tortilla type `flour` or `corn`.
2.  **Cook the protein** - Choose a protein `steak`, `chicken`, `carnitas` or `sofritas`.
3.  **Prepare the toppings** - Add your choice of toppings.
4.  **Assemble the taco** - Combine the tortilla, protein, and toppings into a final taco.

We will be building this tutorial pipeline hands-on.
